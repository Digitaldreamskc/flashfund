# FlashFund Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
FlashFund is an emergency relief funding platform that enables quick financial support for those in urgent need. We need to add trust/verification features to ensure the platform's credibility and user safety.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Trust Features Priority (Speed/Impact Analysis):
   a. Wallet Credibility Badge (High Impact, Fast Implementation)
      - Quick to implement using existing wallet connection
      - Provides immediate visual trust indicator
      - No additional user action required
      - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

   b. Optional Verification Toggle (Medium Impact, Medium Implementation)
      - Requires form modifications
      - Needs backend verification logic
      - User must take action
      - Estimated time: 4-5 hours

   c. Talent Protocol Integration (High Impact, Complex Implementation)
      - Requires external API integration
      - Needs additional authentication flow
      - Complex user experience
      - Estimated time: 8-10 hours

## Lessons
1. Always check for duplicate imports in main entry files
2. Verify all dependencies are properly installed before running the development server
3. Keep track of banned terms when updating content
4. Test wallet integration early in the development process
5. Use absolute paths in Vite config for module resolution
6. When implementing geolocation, handle loading states and errors gracefully
7. Keep emergency categories focused and relevant to the platform's purpose
8. Use the official Solana wallet adapter components for consistent wallet connection UI
9. Prioritize features based on implementation speed and impact
10. When implementing trust features, consider both visual indicators and underlying logic
11. Use transaction history as a reliable metric for wallet trust
12. Implement loading states for async trust calculations
13. Create test components for visual verification of UI features
14. Display trust level requirements for transparency
15. Test trust calculations with various wallet histories
16. Use mock data for testing wallet trust levels to avoid network dependencies
17. Implement test cases that cover all trust level thresholds
18. Consider transaction frequency as a key trust metric
19. Keep test data realistic but easily distinguishable
20. Use relative timestamps for mock data to ensure consistent testing
21. Use framer-motion for smooth animations and transitions
22. Keep role switching easily accessible but not intrusive
23. Show trust badges prominently in donor profiles
24. Use progress bars to visualize funding status
25. Implement responsive layouts for all screen sizes
26. Use AnimatePresence for smooth mounting/unmounting animations
27. Implement staggered animations for list items using index-based delays
28. Use spring animations for more natural motion
29. Add hover and tap animations for better interactivity
30. Keep animations subtle and purposeful to avoid overwhelming users
